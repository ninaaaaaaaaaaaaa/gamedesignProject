Welcome to the Game Readme for our RPG game! In this document, we will provide an overview of the game and its features, as well as instructions on how to play.

Game Overview:
Our RPG game consists of five maps that the player needs to complete to complete the game. Each map has its own unique features, gameplay mechanisms, and challenges.

First Map:
The first map is called King's Garden and is the starting point of the game. In this map, the player is guided by NPCs and must complete three tasks that require navigating and exploring the maze-like garden to collect three lost items. The estimated gameplay time for this stage is 15-30 minutes. This stage involves certain interactions such as picking up items, having conversations, watering flowers, and reading books, restoring status. The player can exit and enter the map at any time, but they must complete all three tasks to play the next stage.

Second Map:
The second map has three levels: easy, medium, and hard. The player needs to pass them in order and has three lives per game. In this map, the player uses the keyboard to move the character and must avoid monsters while collecting all flowers. There are three kinds of monsters, each with unique movements and behaviors. The game also features toolboxes scattered around the map that provide different mechanisms to help the player, such as increasing or decreasing monster movement speed or adding a new monster to the map permanently.

Third Map:
The third map is called Woodland Adventure and is divided into two parts. In the first part, the player encounters small monsters that they need to defeat while collecting gold rewards. Once all the moving monsters are destroyed, the hedge disappears, allowing the player to access the second part of the map. In this part, the player needs to defeat an evil dragon to complete the challenge.

Fourth Map:
The final map is the Mountain Map. The player needs to level up in the previous maps. Player would encounter random enemies on the road. The player must go to the top of the mountain and defeat the monster "ghost" to get the ghost's heart and marry the princess.

How to Play:
To play our RPG game, use the arrow keys or WASD or mouse to control the character's direction. Also player can use the mouse or the 'ENTER' or 'SPACE' key to interact with the environment. If the player is lost, they can talk to the princess or NPCs nearby for guidance.

(Since the playtime for our game is quite long, though we expect the players to fully experience our game, we provide a "cheat switch". It is located at the mian map, the corner between the bushes and the ocean. Press "ENTER" to skip the current stage. Please note that using cheat mode may cause strange error or misplaced notifications. Please use it carefully at your own risk.)

We hope you enjoy playing our RPG game!
